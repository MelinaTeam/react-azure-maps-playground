# Image Layer

You can overlay an image to a fixed set of coordinates with the Image Layer.<br/>
Following code shows how to add a simple image layer. A thorough tutorial can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-maps/map-add-image-layer).<br/>
For more available properties, see the documentation [ImageLayerOptions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/api/azure-maps-control/atlas.imagelayeroptions?view=azure-maps-typescript-latest).

> Note that browsers might have difficulty loading a large image. In this case, consider breaking your image up into tiles, and loading them into the map as a **TileLayer**.
