# Cluster Aggregates
This example shows how to enable point-based clustering on a data source and render them differently from individual points on the map.
Clustered points have four properties:
- `cluster` - A boolean value indicating that it is a cluster.
- `cluster_id` - A unique ID for the cluster which can be used with the DataSource getClusterExpansionZoom, getClusterChildren, and getClusterLeaves functions.
- `point_count` - The number of points the cluster contains.
- `point_count_abbreviated` - A string that abbreviates the point_count value if it is long. (i.e. 4,000 becomes 4K)

For more information on clustering, see the tutorial [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-maps/clustering-point-data-web-sdk).

You can observe the clusters by zooming in and out on the map.

<ClusterAggregates showBubbles showNumbers/>

In this example, we use a **Bubble Layer** to render the clusters as circles and a **Symbol Layer** to render the number of points in each cluster.
For the bubble layer, we set the radius and the color to change based on the numbers of points in the clusters.

<Source code={`
const bubbleLayerOptions = {
  //Scale the size of the clustered bubble based on the number of points in the cluster.
  radius: [
    'step',
    ['get', 'point_count'],
    20, //Default of 20 pixel radius.
    100,
    30, //If point_count >= 100, radius is 30 pixels.
    750,
    40, //If point_count >= 750, radius is 40 pixels.
  ],

  //Change the color of the cluster based on the value of the point_cluster property of the cluster.
  color: [
    'step',
    ['get', 'point_count'],
    'rgba(0,255,0,0.8)', //Default to green.
    100,
    'rgba(255,255,0,0.8)', //If the point_count >= 100, color is yellow.
    750,
    'rgba(255,0,0,0.8)', //If the point_count >= 100, color is red.
  ],
  strokeWidth: 0,
  filter: ['has', 'point_count'], //Only render data points which have a point_count property, which clusters do.
};
`}/>

For the symbol layer, we set the text to be the `point_count_abbreviated` property of the cluster.

<Source code={`
const symbolLayerOptions = {
  iconOptions: {
    image: 'none', //Hide the icon image.
  },
  textOptions: {
    textField: ['get', 'point_count_abbreviated'],
    offset: [0, 0.4],
  },
};
`}/>

Finally, we set the options of the **AzureMapDataSourceProvider** to enable clustering.

<Source code={`
import {
  AzureMap,
  AzureMapDataSourceProvider,
  AzureMapLayerProvider,
  AzureMapsProvider,
} from 'react-azure-maps';

const ClusterAggregates = () => {
  
  return (
      <AzureMapsProvider>
        <AzureMap options={...your_options, center: [-97, 39], zoom: 1.5, view: 'Auto',}>
          <AzureMapDataSourceProvider
            id="ClusterAggregates DataSourceProvider"
            dataFromUrl="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_month.geojson"
            options={{
              //Tell the data source to cluster point data.
              cluster: true,
              //The radius in pixels to cluster points together.
              clusterRadius: 45,
              //The maximium zoom level at which clustering occurs.
              //If you zoom in more than this, all points are rendered as symbols.
              clusterMaxZoom: 15,
            }}
          >
            <AzureMapLayerProvider
                id={'BubbleLayer LayerProvider'}
                options={bubbleLayerOptions}
                type="BubbleLayer"
            ></AzureMapLayerProvider>
            <AzureMapLayerProvider
                id={'NumberLayer2 LayerProvider'}
                options={symbolLayerOptions}
                type="SymbolLayer"
            ></AzureMapLayerProvider>
          </AzureMapDataSourceProvider>
        </AzureMap>
      </AzureMapsProvider>
  );
};
`} />
